# Goal:

Learn how to use HTML5 Canvas.

## Summary:

Canvas has many features. Once you gain access to the canvas through querySelector, get the 2d context, and set the width and height, you can edit the attributes of ctx in order to edit and change the canvas.

ctx.beginPath() - begins path, or resets to a new path
ctx.moveTo(lastX, lastY) - moves the coordinates the path is to the given coordinates
ctx.lineTo(e.offsetX, e.offsetY) - Creates a line to the given coordinate from the last asserted point
ctx.stroke() - draws the path that is defined.
ctx.lineWidth = 100 - change the width of the line.

## One Thing Learned:

The context of a contains all the information you need to change and edit, whether manually or through methods.
